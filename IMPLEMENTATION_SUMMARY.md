## üöÄ Running the Platform

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start infrastructure (MySQL, Elasticsearch)
cd infra/dev && docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations and seed data
cd packages/db && bun run seed

# Start all services
bun dev

# Or start individual services:
bun --filter="@open-bias/api" dev          # API server
bun --filter="@open-bias/admin-ui" dev     # Frontend
bun --filter="@open-bias/ingest-worker" dev # RSS ingestion
bun --filter="@open-bias/enrich-worker" dev # AI analysis
```

## üéâ Achievement Summary

We have successfully created a fully-functional, Ground News-like platform that provides:

- **Comprehensive news bias analysis** across multiple sources
- **Real-time coverage tracking** and blindspot detection
- **AI-powered content analysis** with OpenAI integration
- **User authentication** and personalized experiences
- **Modern, responsive interface** with real-time updates
- **Scalable architecture** ready for production deployment

The platform now offers users the ability to discover news from multiple perspectives, understand bias patterns, and stay informed about potential information blindspots in their news consumption - exactly like Ground News, but as an open-source, self-hostable solution.
