# OpenBias

OpenBias is a comprehensive news bias analysis platform inspired by Ground News. It intelligently aggregates articles from 40+ diverse news sources, performs AI-powered bias analysis, and presents multi-perspective coverage through a modern web interface. The system helps users discover news blindspots and understand media coverage patterns across the political spectrum.

- **üìä Multi-Perspective Coverage**: Track left/center/right source distribution with visual bias indicators
- **üéØ Blindspot Detection**: Automated alerts for missing political perspectives in your news consumption
- **üîç Advanced Story Grouping**: Multi-algorithm similarity matching using TF-IDF, Levenshtein distance, and semantic analysis
- **üì∞ 40+ News Sources**: Continuous ingestion from diverse outlets across the political spectrum
- **üë§ User Authentication**: Personalized experiences with JWT-based security
- **üì± Modern UI**: Responsive Vue.js interface with real-time updates and CoreUI components
- **‚ö° Real-time Processing**: Optimized pipeline with configurable development limits

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

OpenBias follows a microservices architecture with separate workers for ingestion, analysis, and presentation:

    end

        ES[(Elasticsearch<br/>Search & Analytics)]
    end

    subgraph "Frontend"

    end

### Core Components

- **`ingest-worker`**: Monitors 40+ RSS feeds, performs intelligent story grouping with quality controls, and maintains source diversity
- **`enrich-worker`**: AI-powered bias analysis using OpenAI, sentiment detection, and Elasticsearch indexing
- **`api`**: Hono-based REST API with JWT authentication, story endpoints, and user management
- **`admin-ui`**: Vue 3 dashboard with real-time story feed, bias visualization, and user authentication
- **Data Stores**: MySQL for persistent storage, Elasticsearch for advanced search and analytics

## üì¶ Packages

The monorepo contains these interconnected packages:

-   **`packages/admin-ui`**: Vue 3 + TypeScript dashboard with CoreUI components, authentication, and real-time story feeds
-   **`packages/api`**: Hono-based REST API with JWT auth, story endpoints, and bias analysis triggers
-   **`packages/db`**: Drizzle ORM schema with enhanced tables for users, stories, coverage tracking, and AI analysis
-   **`packages/ingest-worker`**: Intelligent RSS monitoring with advanced story grouping and source diversity controls
-   **`packages/enrich-worker`**: AI bias analysis pipeline with OpenAI integration and Elasticsearch indexing
-   **`packages/common`**: Shared TypeScript types and utilities across all packages

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) - For MySQL and Elasticsearch

### 1. Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yuvibirdi/open-bias
cd open-bias

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d

# Configure environment (copy .env.example to .env if needed)
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Initialize Database

```bash
# Apply schema and seed with 40+ news sources
bun --filter @open-bias/db run migrate
bun --filter @open-bias/db run seed
```

### 3. Development Workflow

```bash
# Run all services (recommended for development)
bun --filter '*' run dev

# Or run individual services:
bun --filter @open-bias/api run dev          # Backend API
bun --filter @open-bias/admin-ui run dev     # Frontend UI
bun --filter @open-bias/ingest-worker run dev # RSS ingestion
bun --filter @open-bias/enrich-worker run dev # AI analysis
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### 4. Development Configuration

For faster development without GPU compute, edit processing limits in **one file**:

```typescript
// packages/enrich-worker/src/index.ts
const DEV_ARTICLE_LIMIT: number = 20;     // Articles to process (20 = quick testing)
const DEV_GROUP_ANALYSIS_LIMIT: number = 5; // Groups to analyze (5 = quick testing)
```

**üí° Tip**: Use `-1` for both values in production to process all content.

## üß† AI-Powered Bias Analysis

OpenBias uses advanced algorithms to detect bias patterns and ensure comprehensive coverage:

### Story Grouping Algorithm
- **Multi-technique Similarity**: TF-IDF, Levenshtein distance, and word overlap analysis
- **Strict Quality Controls**: 0.7 combined similarity threshold, source diversity enforcement
- **Time-bound Grouping**: 24-hour window for article clustering
- **Size Limits**: Maximum 15 articles per group to prevent mega-groups

### Bias Detection Features
- **OpenAI Integration**: GPT-powered bias analysis with structured output
- **Coverage Tracking**: Left/center/right source distribution monitoring
- **Blindspot Detection**: Automated alerts for missing perspectives
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Emotional tone and sensationalism scoring

### Configuration Options
```typescript
// Key thresholds (packages/enrich-worker/src/*)
TF_IDF_THRESHOLD: 0.65           // TF-IDF similarity requirement  
TITLE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD: 0.75 // Title matching requirement
COMBINED_THRESHOLD: 0.7          // Overall similarity requirement
MAX_GROUP_SIZE: 15               // Maximum articles per group
```
